# Pawder

## Description

There are thousands of pets in shelters that need to find loving homes. The aim of Pawder is to provide a fun, minimalistic way to connect users with these animals. Remeniscent of dating apps, users "swipe" through pets favoriting the ones they would like to learn more about. Favorited pets are stored in a users list where they can access more information about the pet and find out ways to contact the shelter to start the adoption process.

This represents the initial MVP project done done while enrolled in Hack Reactor. Students are assigned to pick a topic, design, and build a full-stack application over the course of a two day period. Unfortunatly, issues I experienced working with the Petfinder API forced me to cut features that would have made this app much more enjoyable to develop and use in order to make the short deadline. I would like to return to the project in the future to add in those features, possibly using Firebase and developing a native app with React Native.
